Documentary film of
Barbora Chalupova and Vít Klusák

10
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:49,073
Caught in the Net

11
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:04,753
Documentary filmmakers
are looking for an adult actress,

12
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:07,746
looking 12-13 years old.

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:12,233
They have asked to come dressed
as teenagers to the casting.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
- Good morning.
- Morning.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Come sit down.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,520
This is Bára Chalupová, I'm Vít Klusák
and we're directing this documentary.

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,440
Just as we'll decide if we want you,
you also have the option

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,280
of deciding if you want in,
because it's a tricky area.

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,600
We're working on a documentary about
the abuse of children online.

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,480
That's why we're looking for a
young-looking adult woman.

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,000
If we choose you, you'd act
like you were 12.

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,360
We'd use your childhood photos
to create a profile

23
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,400
where you would communicate with
men who would contact you.

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,800
The question is whether you
wouldn't find it too upsetting.

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I have personal
experience with this.

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,920
When I was 12 I also went
on these websites.

27
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,520
We chatted and he started sending
me nude photos of himself.

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,480
I was 12 or 13 and was
going through puberty

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,840
and wouldn't discuss stuff
like that with my parents.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,480
When I was about 14 some man wrote
asking for some photos of me.

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,480
He was able to mess with kids'
heads and did it to me too.

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
He pretended to be a friend but he
wasn't. That was the worst thing.

33
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,320
He claimed to be
three years older than me

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,480
and I liked the idea of an older
boy being interested in me.

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,720
But then he sent some photos
and he was pretty old.

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,280
We chatted about my interests.

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,280
He said he had some pets and asked
if I'd like to see them

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
and what kinds of animals I liked.

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,440
Then we skyped. He said his camera
was broken and never showed himself.

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,000
But he wanted me to wear a light top
and a short skirt, and I did it.

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,480
He used some programme
to get into my webcam.

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,250
I had my notebook open and
whenever I changed

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,520
he used it to watch me.
But I didn't know.

44
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,160
It's not children's fault.
I didn't understand it.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
I was glad to have a friend to write to.
I only realised it was wrong

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,480
when he said he was naked in the bath
thinking about me.

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,040
This is kind of awkward, but
I started masturbating then

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
and he even saw that.

49
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
In the end we were meant to
meet at the Main Train Station.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,720
If mum hadn't checked my phone that
night, who knows how it would have ended.

51
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,280
Some guy wrote to me

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,320
saying he needed my virgin urine.

53
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,400
He said it'd really help him
and that he would pay me.

54
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,450
He said what would really help would be

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,440
if the urine was warm,
if I could pee right there.

56
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,480
It came out he was 45
and abused girls in that way.

57
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,400
He had lots of videos at home with all
kinds of stuff and sold them abroad.

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
Two years later some
guy sent photos of me,

59
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,480
saying if I didn't send him
something he'd make them public.

60
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
To this day I'm afraid something
will turn up somewhere.

61
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Because of it I saw
a psychologist for two years.

62
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

63
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Bye.

64
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Goodbye.

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,570
Out of 23 participants in the casting

66
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:08,863
19 met in childhood
with some form of online harassment.

67
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:16,593
THREE ACTRESSES

68
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,739
THREE CHILDREN'S ROOMS

69
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,329
TEN DAYS

70
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:28,645
ONLINE FROM 12.00 TO MIDNIGHT

71
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,760
- Can we take these drawings?
- They're not from my childhood.

72
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,120
- They fit the story symbolically.
- OK, sure.

73
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
- And the cat too?
- That's a fox!

74
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,320
They're my drawings. I never used
to draw - I'm useless at it.

75
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,240
I preferred to read.

76
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Which reminds me, I've
prepared these books,

77
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
classics like Twilight
and Vampire Academy.

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,560
- And definitely sheet music
- I played the piano a lot.

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,400
I got my mum to send me a parcel

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,240
with all my sheet music.

81
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,440
I got that from mum for my birthday and
my prize possessions are in it:

82
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
stuff I've collected and
letters from Honza.

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,440
We've been going out for ages and
used to write each other at first.

84
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
There's also this little box he
gave me with a ring inside.

85
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,640
The most important thing is this
little house my dad carved.

86
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,440
It was like my safe where I
hid goodies

87
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,320
I didn't want my brother to
eat. But he did anyway.

88
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,400
I also had a diary, where
I recorded my problems.

89
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
You wrote about God,
but you spelt it "Gud".

90
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,360
- You wrote that God probably didn't exist
- otherwise he'd help you more.

91
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,920
I wrote that my breasts weren't growing,
which really troubled me.

92
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,440
- Where was the house?
- I brought it down from the attic.

93
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Mum didn't agree with it

94
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,480
being shown in this project

95
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,440
because my dad made it

96
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,720
and I played with it
my whole childhood.

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,640
But it'll help me to return
to the role of a 12-year old girl.

98
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,040
This heart is from my first boyfriend.

99
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,280
- He won it shooting at a fair?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
- What about your headphones?
- Yeah. I can't live without them.

101
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I see some medals -
we'll borrow them too.

102
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,520
- And photos.
- Thanks, I'll choose a few.

103
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,880
- That's me with my brother.
- Yes indeed.

104
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,960
- At dance class?
- That's right.

105
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,320
It's great you can dance - we
can draw on that on the shoot.

106
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,120
- May I take the cups?
- Sure. Here's a few dolls too.

107
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,480
- What dance style do you do?
- Latin American.

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,320
- I thought it was a real window.
- Me too.

109
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
It's prepared to the last detail.

110
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I had this at home too.

111
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm off to my room.

112
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,000
That's super cute.

113
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
- Wow, you've got a skylight.
- That's my dream.

114
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,960
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

115
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,400
- It fits just right.
- For sure. The perfect spot.

116
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
- I've got a window!
- The light here is gorgeous.

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,560
Jesus, they've got it just right.

118
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,640
For music, I'll put pop, OK?
Dance music...

119
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,280
She plays piano, so put
classical music too.

120
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
"I play the piano
and adore Lady Gaga."

121
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,160
- Lovely.
- Oh my God!

122
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,640
We've got 16 messages
since I set it up.

123
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,320
Fucking hell.

124
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Tereza, come here.

125
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
We've set up a profile for
you on lide.cz.

126
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,200
You've got one profile pic

127
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
and 16 people have sent you...

128
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,000
It's been active only 5 minutes.

129
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
And this is?

130
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Here I was 12 but my brother
stole one of the candles.

131
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,640
"My dumb bro stole the 2 from my cake,
idiot."

132
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,320
By your computers you've all got mobiles
with a camera for selfies.

133
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,400
We've found that when we
have a fake profile

134
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,280
and there's no communication
with a close female friend

135
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,320
it seems less authentic.

136
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Tongues too.

137
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
- Did you see me?
- We can both be in it.

138
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Niki dot Komárková, at sign...

139
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,480
If anyone asks you're Kristýna Jùnová.

140
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,240
- Your birthday...
- In November, right?

141
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,520
- May 20th.
- I'm a Taurus!

142
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,840
Careful or they'll bombard you with
spam. He's calling already. Christ.

143
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,640
We have our first call!

144
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,280
- Some Indian.
- Right. - Bára!

145
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
- We had our first call
- some Indian guy.

146
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
- When?
- Just now.

147
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Because we were taking photos we had
Messenger on and this guy rang us.

148
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Nader.

149
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,053
PROJECT RULES

150
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:55,252
1. We do not initiate chat ourselves,
we just answer.

151
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:59,171
2. At the beginning of the conversation,
note that we are 12 years old.

152
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:02,527
3. Do not flirt. Do not attract.
Do not provoke.

153
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:07,516
4. We respond to sexual suggestions
naively: "I don't know", "I'm ashamed".

154
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,430
5. We respond to requests to send naked
photos only after repeatedly insisting.

155
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:14,257
6. Meeting always
initiated by the molester.

156
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:18,607
7. We consult a psychologist,
sexologist, lawyer and criminologist.

157
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:22,298
8. We use Facebook, Skype,
Snapchat and Omegle.

158
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
So try it.

159
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh my God.

160
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,360
"Hi, my name is Pavel. Let's chat."

161
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
"Man from south Moravia,
around 50."

162
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,520
- Bloody granddad.
- Gross.

163
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,800
- Seriously? - They're ancient.
- Why would he write to a girl of 13?

164
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
"Hi, you're pretty and sweet."

165
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,520
He just looks like a weirdo.

166
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,560
What about this one?
"Hi, fancy a chat?"

167
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,560
How old is he, 13?

168
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,440
That one? I can never tell with boys.

169
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,280
- Thirteen, 14?
- No way. Maybe 10.

170
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,360
I don't want to deal with this one,
but...

171
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
"Fancy chatting?"

172
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
It's nuts. Like if my granddad
wrote and said

173
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
"Hi, fancy chatting?"

174
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
But hats off he knows
how to use internet.

175
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Fair point.

176
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,560
- "Ever had sex with a boy?"
- What the hell?

177
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,480
- Do you get it?
- He's got mushrooms.

178
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,680
Gardening, mushroom picking, fishing.
What's that? Marijuana? No...

179
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,280
Be a bit vague, like our
code of conduct says.

180
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,440
OK.

181
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,560
- "The boys in class are dumb."
- "Do they want to fuck you?"

182
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,560
"They want their knob in your cunt." Too
extreme. A girl of 12 wouldn't reply.

183
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,930
If you were contacted like this

184
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,480
If you were contacted like this

185
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
which ones would you respond to?

186
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,440
I can imagine that at 12, just out
of curiosity,

187
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,440
I'd really like to poke
into this hornet's nest,

188
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,480
just to see what happens.

189
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,080
- To see how far you can go?
- Yeah, to find out what he's after.

190
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,480
Maybe to provoke him a bit, but not
like sending him nude photos.

191
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,840
But a girl of 12 isn't dumb. She
knows when a boy's got a hard-on.

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,040
So you might click on a profile even
knowing that's what they're after?

193
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,280
Yeah, but definitely not with the aim

194
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,480
of having a video chat and
masturbating together.

195
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
To me it's nuts they'd
expect a girl to do that.

196
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,440
It just struck me... did we
even enter a chat room?

197
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
No.

198
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,560
They approached us just
because we're online.

199
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,720
- As new faces.
- Gross.

200
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,560
- Bára, are you listening in?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Right.

202
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Stay strong.

203
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,880
Are we ready?

204
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,240
Cameras rolling. Sound rolling.

205
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,480
Let's do this.

206
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Careful, don't touch your mic.

207
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

208
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,480
- What's up?
- How are you?

209
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,280
Fine, and you?

210
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm good. I'm home alone,
which is cool.

211
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,560
- What are you up to?
- Just chatting.

212
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm waiting for mum to get home -
then I have to go straight to bed.

213
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,120
You can't waste time
when you're home alone.

214
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,520
Where are you?

215
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,640
Right now I'm at the toilet.

216
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,320
- I'm on holidays.
- Who with?

217
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
- With my mates.
- Your mates?

218
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
"User P____ F____ took a picture."

219
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,720
Don't take photos of me!

220
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I thought we'd chat.

221
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Tomorrow, OK?

222
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
"How would you rate
the quality of this conversation?"

223
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
That's a dick.

224
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
That's really gross!
Really gross!

225
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
Come and join us.

226
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,760
It's remarkable how they have zero
interest in the impact of what they do.

227
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,280
It's the utilitarian
use of that child.

228
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,520
It's sexuality devoid of any feeling.

229
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,520
I need to come, that's what you're
here for, then Seeya?

230
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,400
That's awful. I just don't know...

231
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
But that's not how it is in most cases.

232
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,320
I know. I'm in a pretty
decent relationship.

233
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,040
But if those young girls
are exposed to this

234
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,250
what kind of mindset will they
have when it comes to a relationship?

235
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
They're definitely shocked.

236
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,760
- It also establishes a norm...
- Which can be highly distorted.

237
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,360
when it comes to how it will
be with men later.

238
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,000
Hi.

239
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Do you think it's dumb
you can't see me?

240
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,330
I'm a bit afraid.
I've no idea who I'm talking to.

241
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,520
I see. I don't show my face
much on the web.

242
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,600
What grade are you in?

243
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Seventh.

244
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,280
You... put your hand under the table.

245
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,440
- Yeah.
- But why?

246
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,840
Why not? Do you mind?

247
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,520
- Yeah.
- I won't do it then.

248
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,360
You never did anything like that?

249
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,560
I've never done anything,
so I don't know what it's like.

250
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,600
Actually me neither.

251
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,560
You've never done it either?

252
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Some stuff yeah, but I've
never fully done it.

253
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,520
It? What's "it"?

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,960
Sex. Like all the way.

255
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Maybe that's why
I'm here online

256
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,560
trying to find some other ways.

257
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,120
Maybe you could find a girlfriend,
or at least try to.

258
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,360
Maybe it's not as hard as it seems.

259
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,480
It's already a bit weird. I'm
a little older than you.

260
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,160
Other boys have done it
but for me still nothing.

261
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,280
Still, I hope you find a girlfriend.

262
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:40,280
I think it's better to have a real
girl than over the internet.

263
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Jesus.

264
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,480
- Good afternoon.
- Hiya.

265
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,160
- What will we chat about?
- Whatever you like.

266
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,440
Yeah? How old are you actually?
Around 12?

267
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,360
- OK. You're pretty.
- How old are you?

268
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,000
- Forty-five. Is that a lot?
- I guess not.

269
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,200
- Already in your pyjamas?
- No.

270
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Do you fancy me even a bit?

271
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,960
- Want to see it?
- See what?

272
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,640
My penis.

273
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Ever seen one before?

274
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,840
- Yeah, but only on the internet.
- Yeah?

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
- Have you ever watched porn?
- Yeah, with a friend.

276
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,720
I'll take my t-shirt off.

277
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,000
You don't feel hot anymore?

278
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,440
Hot? No, I feel good.

279
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Hang on, I'll take my trousers off.

280
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
It's starting to get hard.

281
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,120
- I see. Why?
- You turn me on.

282
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I'll take my boxers off too.

283
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Come on, I'll show it to you.

284
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,640
- Can you see my big belly?
- Yeah.

285
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,000
But you don't find it too pleasant,
do you? Say something.

286
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,760
I've got you back on my monitor.

287
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
At least show me your breasts.

288
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Don't worry. I'm far away -
I can't do a thing to you.

289
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Does your mum know?

290
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,560
- That you're showing me your penis?
- Yeah.

291
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
No way. I'd be in big trouble.

292
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,560
That's my point.

293
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,320
On TV they often say that
young girls visit chat rooms

294
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,520
and I know parents worry.

295
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,440
On one hand it's right
they keep tabs on kids,

296
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,520
but on the other they limit you a bit.

297
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,520
So which side is right?

298
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,360
- Would you like to get together?
- I guess not.

299
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
You'd prefer a younger guy?

300
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,440
I guess I can hold
off on boys for a bit.

301
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,440
- For sure.
- Yeah.

302
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,200
At 12 you're just starting to develop.

303
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
You're a young rosebud.

304
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,120
I'm getting cold.
I'll put my shirt on.

305
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Good idea.

306
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,040
I guess I'll go to bed.

307
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,360
Yeah?

308
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,920
- Take care then.
- Bye.

309
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,960
It doesn't matter that I'm 12?

310
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,920
Not if it stays our secret.

311
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,760
- You really don't mind that I'm 12?
- I'm trying not to think about it.

312
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,560
- You don't mind me being 12?
- Why should I,

313
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,520
when we fancy each other?

314
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,080
Who cares. I was 12 once too.

315
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,520
You are young. But if you don't mind...

316
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,040
You do know I'm 12?
You don't mind?

317
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,520
- No. Will you show yourself to me too?
- I don't think so. Sorry.

318
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,520
- Why not?
- I'm really shy.

319
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Try it. If you help me,
I'll jizz for you.

320
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,480
These men often wrongly think

321
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,440
that when the girl doesn't actively
resist, she must want it.

322
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,560
They forget that it's totally natural

323
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,360
for a person to behave a bit submissively
when they encounter someone above them

324
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,200
who is bigger physically, with
a deep voice, older.

325
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,160
The consent is illusory.

326
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,080
If the girl didn't feel pressured,

327
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,400
she would never agree to it.

328
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,240
Many people think they're pedophiles,
but that's not the case.

329
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:33,160
In pedophilia it's not so much about
looking at photos of naked children.

330
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,240
It's about being in
their children's world,

331
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,640
communicating with them -
that's the attraction.

332
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,960
Even the research says
that there's only 3-5% of pedofiles

333
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,400
among those who chase
children on the internet.

334
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,040
This one is online...
Jan Nováèek junior.

335
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
- I'm curious who Jan Nováèek senior is?
- His dad I guess.

336
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
- "You're really pretty..."
- "Thanks."

337
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,520
- "Man from Ústí region, 30"
- God, he's gross.

338
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,400
"What are you wearing?"

339
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,440
"Hairy socks."
I'm not sure about the spelling.

340
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,080
- "Any hair down there yet?"
- He's asking about your crotch, right?

341
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,400
- "I'm embarrassed!!!"
- "Don't be shy. You're pretty."

342
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,760
- "Have you had sex?"
- "I'm just 12."

343
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,520
- "Do you stroke your pussy?"
- "Why?"

344
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
"Look at my profile."

345
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,840
But it's public! Christ!

346
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,440
How should I respond?
"Why do you do it?"

347
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,490
Bára is our make-up artist.

348
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,360
Bára is our make-up artist.

349
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,400
She says she maybe knows one of
these guys personally.

350
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,370
If it's really him, and both
the photo and the region fit,

351
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,200
If it's really him, and both
the photo and the region fit,

352
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,600
then it's a man who works with kids and
runs children's camps.

353
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,400
He comes into contact
with a lot of kids.

354
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,480
He's only got one photo here,
so it may be stolen.

355
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,760
It might not be him.
But if it is, that's a problem.

356
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,640
If he worked with kids
and it is him

357
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,440
we just can't keep it to ourselves.

358
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Here I go.

359
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

361
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Is it him?

362
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,360
- Will you take your t-shirt off?
- What?

363
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Will you take your t-shirt off?

364
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,400
- I don't think so.
- Come on.

365
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,840
No, I'm a bit shy.

366
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,520
You have no reason to be.

367
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,240
- Can you stand up for a moment?
- Why?

368
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I want to see how you look overall.

369
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I look normal.

370
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
What's your name?

371
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,960
- Martin. And yours?
- Míša. - Nice name.

372
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,120
Is it Martin? Did he give his real name?

373
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,720
He's suddenly so sleazy.

374
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,600
- And what else do you do?
- I go to school, chat...

375
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,560
- How about you?
- I have a small travel agency.

376
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,480
- Like excursions?
- Yeah, a travel agency.

377
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,560
- Is your mum home?
- No, she's at work.

378
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,760
That's great.

379
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,840
- I want to see you without the t-shirt.
- Doesn't it matter that I'm 12?

380
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,080
- No. Does it matter to you?
- Maybe... I don't know.

381
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,400
There you go.

382
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
- Will you take it off?
- What?

383
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,040
- Your t-shirt.
- No.

384
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,480
- Just for a bit.
- But I want to talk.

385
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,280
We can talk without the t-shirt.
Don't be shy. Just for a bit.

386
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Then your bum. That isn't visible.

387
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
- Yeah?
- No.

388
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,920
- Show me what's on your shirt.
- A horse.

389
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,440
- Take it off.
- No.

390
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,520
Where are you?

391
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
- What?
- Are you at home, or where?

392
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,320
In a room. It's my bedroom
and office in one.

393
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,720
I've got a living room,
but I'm not there.

394
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,960
- I'll show it to you.
- All right.

395
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,560
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.

396
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,160
- Show me around your room.
- OK.

397
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Here is my bed.

398
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,360
I drew this myself with a friend.
Can you see it?

399
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,120
Yeah. Nice.

400
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,440
Here I've got my stuff, my sheet music.

401
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,560
And a window, a piano
and a huge mess.

402
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,320
- Nice room.
- Thanks.

403
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,560
You saw my place.

404
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,360
- So we're even.
- I've got to go. Take care.

405
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,400
- Will you show me more of it?
- No, I've got to go.

406
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,520
- See you.
- Bye, sweetie.

407
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,480
- Your mic is lit up.
- Ah!

408
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,480
He didn't notice. We'll tape over it
and then we can continue.

409
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,840
- So it's him?
- It's him.

410
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,280
The job description fits,
everything does.

411
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,800
What does he actually do?

412
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,240
He organises camps, ski trips,
children's events.

413
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,160
- You can't be serious!
- Compared to yesterday's chat

414
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,240
that was far tougher, even though
he didn't masturbate in front of me.

415
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,840
But I felt like...

416
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm not dumb, I know why he wanted
me to walk around the room, but...

417
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,800
Get set! Let's go!
Cameras rolling?

418
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,440
If you can't take photos,
take your t-shirt off.

419
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,760
No, I'm really embarrassed.

420
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,160
I'm not pretty.
Are you taking photos of me?

421
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,800
- Yeah. - Why?
- You're gorgeous. Turn around.

422
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,440
- Turn round.
- Which way?

423
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Turn the other way.
Your whole body

424
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,560
- Why?
- Turn round completely.

425
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,530
- Now take your t-shirt off.
- No!

426
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,360
Stand up in a way
your face can't be seen.

427
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,400
- Why?
- I want to see how pretty you are.

428
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
I'd rather play the piano for you.

429
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,840
- So play.
- All right. What?

430
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,720
- Perhaps a bit of Bach.
- Bach? OK.

431
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,800
- You've got a lovely bum too.
- No!

432
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
- Yes.
- I don't.

433
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,600
- That's one I know.
- You're really good.

434
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
You've got a lovely smile.

435
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
- You're really pretty.
- No.

436
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,560
Don't be shy, sweetie.
I'll look forward to the photo.

437
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,040
- What?
- I look forward to the photo.

438
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,480
- What photo?
- You know, a photo of you.

439
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,520
All right, sweetie.
We'll keep in touch, OK?

440
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,440
- Bye.
- See you.

441
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Thank you. Switch, please.

442
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,480
Hold that pose... a little longer...

443
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,970
Last one. Thanks. Switch, please.

444
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,560
Last one. Thanks. Switch, please.

445
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I'd do a smile, but forced,
like we rehearsed it.

446
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Each girl has around four
nude photographs.

447
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,920
They're not their bodies
but photomontages.

448
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,040
We'll send them to 30 or 40 men and
see if they try using them against us.

449
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,960
Do kids really send them voluntarily?

450
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,480
Seemingly voluntarily -
they're still teens

451
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,810
who mightn't be able to think through
the consequences and vulnerability

452
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,120
who mightn't be able to think through
the consequences and vulnerability

453
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,720
that could follow.

454
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Why do they send these pics?

455
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,280
It may be so as not to lose contact
with someone who's chatting to them.

456
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,440
That can be very important for
the girl, particularly at an age

457
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,400
when teenage disagreements
with parents may start.

458
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,440
And here's someone who
fills that need for them.

459
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,320
It often happens they regret it at
once but by then the blackmail starts.

460
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,010
Like "I'll tell your friend,
everyone will know.

461
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,480
Like "I'll tell your friend,
everyone will know.

462
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,560
We'll say it at your school
and to your mum."

463
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,440
Some kids can't imagine
confessing the truth

464
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,480
and see ending their lives
as the only solution.

465
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,560
That's easier than telling their
parents what's happened.

466
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,090
"Hi"

467
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,930
"Hi"

468
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,960
You're not going to speak?

469
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,920
"What will you show me?"

470
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,360
I don't know.

471
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,560
"Stand up and
take your sweatshirt off."

472
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,560
"Take your t-shirt off."

473
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,360
"I'm horny."

474
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
I see.

475
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm super interested in what you
wrote about your perversions.

476
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,400
"Quite a few, eh?"

477
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
It's really weird.

478
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,440
"It's different, that's why I like it."

479
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
What was it you wrote about dogs?

480
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,960
"I have a friend, a girl, who does it."

481
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,880
- Really?
- "I don't, I just watch."

482
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
"Yes."

483
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
- "I'll send you the videos."
- OK then.

484
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,840
"I want you to undress."

485
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,440
Isn't it abuse of animals?

486
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,560
"They like it, otherwise they
wouldn't do it."

487
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
"I'm starting to be annoyed. You said
you'd show me whatever I want."

488
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,440
But you said you'd give me
500 crowns a week.

489
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,040
How much would you give me
just for stripping?

490
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,320
"It's 500 a week for pics, messages
and showing yourself naked."

491
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Are you jerking off?

492
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,560
"Yeah."

493
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,440
"Let's wrap it up. Seems like
you're not up for it."

494
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,680
Up for what?

495
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,520
- He really sent a dog!
- Don't press play.

496
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,440
Anyone got anything else?

497
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,800
I've got four.

498
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,960
Have you got anyone, Sabina?

499
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,080
- Yeah, loads.
- OK, now we're with you.

500
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,560
Holy shit.

501
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,640
She has 900 Facebook requests.

502
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,720
- So call him.
- Ready? - Yeah.

503
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,160
"Interested in making money?"

504
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
"Making money how?"

505
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
I'm calling him.

506
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Hi.

507
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,840
- What are you up to?
- I just got home from school.

508
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,560
What's new?

509
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,960
Nothing, I guess.

510
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,560
- And with you?
- Nothing.

511
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,520
So you're interested in the money?

512
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,600
It's up to you.
I'm not forcing you into anything.

513
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
How would it work with the money?

514
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,200
I'll pop it into an envelope, you
give me the address and I'll post it.

515
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,480
Then you accept delivery. Easy.

516
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,960
And what for?

517
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,530
Showing yourself to me
and doing as I say.

518
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,400
What would I have to do?

519
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Show me your breasts, properly,

520
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,560
then strip down below -
and then we'll see.

521
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,320
How much would you give me?

522
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,000
Depends on the stuff you do.

523
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,840
So how much?

524
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,320
If you do what I want, 2,000 crowns.

525
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Will you show me the
money on camera?

526
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,640
One sec, I'll see how much
I have on me.

527
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,120
And it's worth that much money to you?

528
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,400
You're pretty. I like how you look.

529
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Why don't you just watch porn?

530
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm not so into porn.
I prefer it live like this.

531
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,090
- You'd really send me money?
- Yeah.

532
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,480
- You'd really send me money?
- Yeah.

533
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,890
Though I don't know how.
By post maybe.

534
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Though I don't know how.
By post maybe.

535
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
- Every week?
- Yeah.

536
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,040
But you said...

537
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,640
"User Sneeky took a picture"

538
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,760
that girls who sleep with
boys for money are...

539
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,320
...that they're whores.

540
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,520
- That's really rude.
- No, it isn't.

541
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,600
You wrote you'd send me 500
crowns a week?

542
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Yeah.

543
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,080
- What for exactly?
- We'll agree on that.

544
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
Will we?

545
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,240
Yeah. I've got to go change
some wheels.

546
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,360
- Ok, see you.
- Later.

547
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
You're not shy, eh?

549
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,440
- How old are you?
- 43.

550
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
- You really don't mind me being 12?
- No.

551
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,680
When I was 35 I had a
girlfriend of 13.

552
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,000
- Nobody could do a thing about it.
- Honestly? - Yeah.

553
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,440
- And you also did... it together?
- Yeah. That too.

554
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,440
- Everything?
- Everything.

555
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,320
Then she ran away and came
to live with me.

556
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,480
She hid at my place for a one month.
They looked for her everywhere.

557
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,800
Then her mum said she and the dad
had accepted it and wouldn't stop her.

558
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,720
- How is it going out with someone young?
- Normal.

559
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,400
Today most 13-year olds are as mature as

560
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,520
if they were 25.

561
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Why aren't you still together?

562
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,000
She started losing weight fast so we
went to the doctor and she had cancer.

563
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,120
A year later she died.

564
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,320
Tell me something about yourself.
Forget the past,

565
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,760
now I'm interested in you.

566
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:39,040
What's most beautiful for a
girl is a romantic day

567
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,480
when the guy is experienced

568
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:49,400
and drives you wild and next
thing you're not a virgin.

569
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,040
If I knew we'd meet, I
wouldn't have left Plzeò.

570
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,600
- Where do you live now?
- Far away.

571
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,560
In England.

572
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,000
Boo.

573
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
You wouldn't fancy England?

574
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,680
- Lots.
- You'd like it? Yeah?

575
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,440
Will you come see me?

576
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,640
If we get to know each other well,

577
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,720
I'll find a school for you -
so we can be together.

578
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
No?

579
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,720
- What do you like doing...
- Sorry, mum's coming.

580
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,440
I'm off to England. To study.

581
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,450
I want you to send me a photo,
but a nice one.

582
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,130
I want you to send me a photo,
but a nice one.

583
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Like the one you sent me
with the cushion -

584
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,480
one like that, but with your face.

585
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,400
A cute snap, maybe when you're in bed.

586
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,400
- One like that, OK?
- Just the face, or...?

587
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,520
A normal one, with you
under the quilt, say.

588
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,720
- But I've got no breasts.
- Don't say that. They're nice.

589
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,600
- Just for a sec. - What for a sec?
- I want to see your breasts.

590
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,600
- Please, not now.
- Sweetie...

591
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,000
Don't cry.

592
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,280
- Not now.
- OK, I didn't say a thing.

593
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,520
Don't cry. If you do,
I'll look the other way.

594
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,560
You're beautiful. Don't be sad.

595
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,760
- Can you see me now?
- Yeah.

596
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
Get up.

597
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,200
I can't see anything.

598
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,280
- Will you take off your pyjama top?
- What?

599
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,840
- Take it off.
- No. No way.

600
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
Will you take me a photo?

601
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,880
I've never tried it.

602
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,320
Go to the bathroom, take off
your top and take me a selfie.

603
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,560
- Is that your room?
- It is, yeah.

604
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,120
Will you show it to me?

605
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,400
This is my bed, wardrobe
and I've got a little rabbit.

606
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Here he is.

607
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,640
Nice.

608
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,320
Will you send a daring photo?

609
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,400
- A photo? I'm not sure
- Of your breasts, maybe.

610
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,520
- I'm not sure
- Will you?

611
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,600
I'll send you something too.

612
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,400
Bye for now. You're so pretty.

613
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,280
Bloody hell, this is really hard.

614
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,320
Show me your breasts, baby.

615
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,480
What? My breasts? No.

616
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,760
It'll hurt me. Please, ease my pain.

617
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,160
It hurts. Come on now.

618
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,960
What do you mean, it'll hurt?

619
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,160
Semen returns to the man's body
and then it hurts.

620
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,440
Just show me your breasts
so I can come.

621
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,680
- You're not Czech?
- I'm half-Czech.

622
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:17,360
- It really hurts?
- Awfully. It's the same for every guy.

623
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,200
I never knew guys suffered.

624
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,720
You don't have a dick, so
how would you know?

625
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,840
You're so pretty. I want you.

626
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,520
I expect we'll get together.

627
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,800
So show me your breasts
already - help me!

628
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,960
I don't want to hurt you.

629
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,080
But if you don't show me your breasts

630
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:54,280
and it hurts real bad, I'll probably
end up in hospital tomorrow.

631
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,640
Because of me?

632
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,840
I guess so.

633
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,520
What would they do to you
at the hospital?

634
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
I don't know.

635
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Maybe you need...

636
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:18,120
Please, I want to come already. Let's
leave the chat for later.

637
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,600
Will you be angry with me
if I don't do it?

638
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
I will.

639
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,480
"Your pic will be online. In school.
Your mum'll see it."

640
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,800
No fucking way!

641
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,360
- "I'll do it because you're nasty."
- Now he's using blackmail!

642
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,400
Are you going to post
that pic somewhere?

643
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,440
I didn't want to send it.

644
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,520
You wrote you wouldn't show it to
anybody, that you're no asshole.

645
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,480
And now you say it's going
on the internet?

646
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,440
- But why?
- You're nasty.

647
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,400
Why?

648
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,480
You like to hurt people.

649
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,120
You hurt people.

650
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,880
Absolutely untrue.

651
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,120
- You promised to show me your breasts.
- I did not.

652
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,560
I just said we'd swap pics.
Mum will murder me.

653
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,760
Lift your t-shirt up.

654
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,960
- Just show me your breasts.
- No way!

655
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,480
- Yes, you will.
- I'll erase the photo.

656
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,560
It's already in my archive.

657
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,280
So show them to me.

658
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,400
- Hi.
- Hi there.

659
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,920
- How old are you?
- Guess.

660
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,560
- About 30.
- I'm 26.

661
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,400
What about me?

662
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,560
You're 12 or 13.

663
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,480
Twelve.

664
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,640
- Are you a student?
- Not any more. I work in Brno.

665
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,920
- What did you study?
- Engineering. At university.

666
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Do you often chat with people?

667
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,040
Just with guys who want to chat.

668
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,840
- Just chatting?
- Well, you know...

669
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,560
Some are interested in something else.

670
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,520
Such as?

671
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,920
I'd rather not say.

672
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,480
Do you think it's the same,
making love like this

673
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,480
and in reality?

674
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,520
- It's different.
- What's the difference?

675
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,800
You don't touch the other person,
but you have your imagination.

676
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,200
- But you've already made love?
- Yeah.

677
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,360
Maybe you could show me something,

678
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
just a little.

679
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,920
- Please.
- I'm even shy with myself.

680
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,720
If you showed me something,
it'd help me.

681
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,640
And what would help me?

682
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:12,600
I'd tell you how to use your
fingers, stuff like that.

683
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,400
- Does that turn you on?
- Yeah.

684
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Even though I'm 12?

685
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,480
As I said, I don't mind.

686
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,400
Oh man. Fucking hell.

687
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

688
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,360
When you said you watch porn...

689
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah.

690
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,440
what sites do you use?

691
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,520
For example, x_____.com

692
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,440
And you watch girls as young as me?

693
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,720
Hardly ever. Sometimes.

694
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,080
That stuff exists?

695
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,760
I use one site with videos like that.

696
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,960
You're not allowed to download it
but there are sites with that stuff.

697
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,240
Get her to ask, What does
a girl need to become a woman?

698
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,280
I can send you a video - not
of sex, just what's on there.

699
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,320
Not to scare you by sending sex
right off,

700
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,440
I'll send one young video
so you can see what's there.

701
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,440
What must a girl have to
become a woman?

702
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,520
I'm not sure what she needs.

703
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's more about behaviour.

704
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Do you think I behave like a woman?

705
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,720
You behave nicely.

706
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,560
OK, I guess I'll send it...

707
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,480
Send it by Skype. I'll send you one too.

708
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,560
- OK.
- Bye, my love.

709
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,320
- Bye, my love.
- Bye, my love.

710
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,840
What did he say?

711
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,280
- What's that?
- What did you...?

712
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,920
Can you play that video?
What is it?

713
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,360
- Jesus, she must be 10.
- She's got no breasts at all.

714
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,560
- That's a vibrator.
- She's a little girl. - Super young.

715
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,680
- Can you please stop it?
- I'm trying.

716
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,360
When I see what you're doing
and who you're communicating with,

717
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,530
it's a real torrent of every
illegal act and crime

718
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,410
it's a real torrent of every
illegal act and crime

719
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,440
against children one can imagine.

720
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,440
I counted at least eight.

721
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,480
All these predators you unfortunately
have to communicate with

722
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,970
deserve to be jailed.

723
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,490
These are very serious crimes,
including rape and blackmail

724
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,440
endangering the upbringing of children,
inciting immorality,

725
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,480
sexual abuse other than
through intercourse.

726
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,360
These are all forms of base behaviour,
masturbation, etc. -

727
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,520
basically everything you've seen,
and much more besides.

728
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,960
What I've seen here is the lowest
filth I've ever come across.

729
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,640
Given the number of such people online,
can anything really be done about it?

730
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:37,480
This is the consequence, but what's
very important is blocking it.

731
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,440
I'm surprised that providers
of such services

732
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,440
don't filter or control this
communication in any way.

733
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,520
They should administer their sites and
if they discover this is happening

734
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,440
they should clearly take action.

735
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,480
But that would force down
user numbers

736
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,400
and of course they get rich from ads.

737
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:08,840
That'd be a disaster for them, so they
create a space where this can happen.

738
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,280
So I'm calling.

739
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,560
Get set.

740
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Nobody wants me!

741
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,360
They do want me!

742
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,680
- Calm down, Tereza.
- Sorry, I'm doing my best.

743
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,160
- It's someone else, right?
- It doesn't matter.

744
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,400
- Hi.
- Can you hear me?

745
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,280
- Sure.
- Can you see me too? - Yeah.

746
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,560
- I can't see you.
- One sec.

747
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,440
Hi.

748
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,560
Good afternoon.

749
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,720
How are you? The weekend's
coming, so that's cool.

750
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,720
- Some free time.
- Yeah.

751
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,960
- How old are you?
- How old do you think?

752
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,040
About 70.

753
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,160
Not yet, thank God.

754
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,800
- I'm 12. Is that OK?
- That's cool.

755
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,040
So you're like 60?

756
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,720
Fifty.

757
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,720
- My granddad's 50 too.
- Yeah?

758
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,800
- Do you have grandkids?
- Yeah.

759
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,280
I do.

760
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,880
How old are they?

761
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,240
Twenty and 22.

762
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,360
- Is the grandmother around?
- She is.

763
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,040
Don't you love her anymore?

764
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
I do.

765
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,040
Why?

766
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,600
Well, you're calling me.

767
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,520
So what? We're just chatting.

768
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
That's true.

769
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,520
How about you?
Got any suitors?

770
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,360
Loads!

771
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,440
You're not sad then.

772
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,520
- Mainly online.
- Yeah, that's possible these days.

773
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,480
Do you play with the boys too?

774
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:05,640
You don't have a prince charming
you can snuggle up with?

775
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,560
No.

776
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,320
What are you doing there?

777
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,800
Nothing. I was just polishing something.

778
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,280
"Just polishing"!

779
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,920
Hey, the guy who sent me the porn
with the dog and the girl

780
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,600
is now threatening he'll post
my photos online.

781
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:50,000
If I don't reply, he'll post them
and my mum won't be happy.

782
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Let's call him.

783
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,560
Hey, one second, I've got something.

784
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,000
- Looks like he did post the photos.
- Show us.

785
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,240
- Jesus Christ.
- We've got a new profile.

786
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,120
Show us. Your face is visible too.

787
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:29,360
It must be unbelievable when a girl
sees her pics have been posted.

788
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,680
My nude photos are all over lide.cz.

789
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:41,920
"Are you going to behave right, then?
Otherwise they're staying up. Got it?"

790
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:47,400
"Should I leave them up?
It was your choice. Seeya."

791
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,400
"If you can't even say Hi I'll
post them elsewhere."

792
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,320
"You're making it worse, not replying.
What will your folks say?"

793
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,160
Fucking hell, if I was 12
I'd jump off a bridge.

794
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,640
- Can you report it?
- I don't know how.

795
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,760
- It must be possible.
- So help me find it here.

796
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

797
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,440
Have you got a webcam?

798
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,520
One sec, I'm trying to turn it on.

799
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,440
- How old are you?
- Guess.

800
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,520
About 30?

801
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,240
Twenty. I'm 20.

802
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,120
- Are you a student?
- Yeah, third level.

803
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,760
Thank God, I wouldn't fancy working yet.

804
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,560
- Where do you study?
- I'm at nursing college.

805
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,520
What a choice - it's super difficult.

806
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,600
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

807
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,040
Why isn't she with you?

808
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,320
I still live with my
folks and so does she.

809
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,040
Why are you chatting to me?

810
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:24,440
I like chatting to anybody with a brain
and you don't seem dumb, so it's cool.

811
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,720
Thanks.

812
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:34,280
You know, one guy offered me
money to strip.

813
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,440
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

814
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:46,560
Simple. If you did it, it could be all
over the place. Not nice.

815
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,920
But I've got a nice body.

816
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:58,440
Cool, liking yourself is the
first step to success but

817
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,920
it's your privacy, so only someone you
love should see it.

818
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Not some stranger who wouldn't
give a damn about you.

819
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,400
I don't know what I'd do
if that happened.

820
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,440
I do. You'd cry and your mum
and dad would be pissed off.

821
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,720
Then you'd have to find out
which asshole did it.

822
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,840
You're not the only one boys have
tried it on with. A few were into me.

823
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,560
Hilarious.

824
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:42,200
They were also touching themselves,
you know, between their legs.

825
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,440
I'd have helped them get off too,
but I'd need a chainsaw

826
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,680
or big boots to make sure they never
did it again, because it's wrong.

827
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,920
I took the piss out of a girl who
promised to show me everything.

828
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:06,520
I said, Seriously? Show me your brain -
cut your skull open and just take it out.

829
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,760
She blocked me right away.

830
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,240
If she says she'll show everything
why not the brain too?

831
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,040
Evidently there wasn't one.
Most interesting.

832
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,960
Did she send you pics?

833
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,600
No. I would've just deleted them anyway.
What is she to me?

834
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Doesn't it turn you on?

835
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,480
No. If I want to get turned on
I've got a girlfriend,

836
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,240
or there's billions of porn sites where
I can find what I like

837
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,360
and I don't need some girl I don't know.

838
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,440
I find you quite attractive.

839
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,600
I try to look good, though I've just
got out of the bath,

840
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,680
which feels good after being
on my feet all day.

841
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,440
What?

842
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,480
You hardly know me.

843
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,560
If you say you do, I'll ask you something
and there's no way you'll know it.

844
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Ask away.

845
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,800
What colour are your eyes?
They look black.

846
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,440
Brown.

847
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,640
Brown?

848
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:52,160
Let's see. You're shy, sincere,
a trier, on the quiet side.

849
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
What's wrong?

850
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,120
- What is it?
- Nothing.

851
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,400
So your eyes are just sweating?
Or they're bored?

852
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,920
- Can I call you back in a bit?
- Sure. But what's up?

853
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,120
- Later.
- Bye.

854
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,360
I need a tissue.

855
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,080
Bloody hell.

856
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,320
That was really touching. Sorry.

857
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,960
What a nice boy.

858
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,450
- He's so nice.
- One of the good guys.

859
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,480
- He's so nice.
- One of the good guys.

860
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,600
After these 10 days I'm moved when
I come across somebody decent.

861
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,960
I'm curious how these guys who've
contacted us will react

862
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,560
when we disappear from this world.

863
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:35,920
Will they be left with some feeling?
Will we have some impact on them?

864
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,240
After our chats, did they say to
themselves, Christ, she was only 12?

865
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:48,440
Suddenly we'll be gone and maybe
some of them will miss us.

866
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:56,880
I really hope they're left with some
kind of feeling, even though I doubt it.

867
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,320
It'll be so great to see you in person.

868
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,880
I'll be nice to you. Don't you worry.

869
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,240
When could we meet in person?

870
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:16,120
I could arrange a weekend at a cottage
in January. I'd buy you nice underwear.

871
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,600
Anything you want.

872
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:27,880
We can meet up when you're in Prague.
You can play the piano and meet my cat.

873
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,960
We could meet sometime.

874
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,600
- You'd want to?
- Yeah. - For real?

875
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,440
- Would you like to?
- I don't know. What would we do?

876
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,360
I'd take you to a cake shop
for a cocoa.

877
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,800
Maybe some cake too.

878
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,920
- If you eat cake, that is?
- I love cake.

879
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,520
If we just place this here like so.

880
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,520
The last switch - the last one.

881
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,280
This is a wireless earpiece.
Put it in your ear.

882
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,480
Hello Sabinka. Can we hear each other?

883
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Yeah, I can hear you Bára.

884
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,400
If it gets uncomfortable, just say.

885
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,600
- Just so you don't feel sick.
- It's fine.

886
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,520
Really get him talking.

887
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Bring up again the stuff that seemed
important during the chat.

888
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,360
- Is the sound OK?
- Rolling.

889
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,730
Camera rolling.

890
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,450
Camera rolling.

891
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,550
BODYGUARD

892
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,760
He's here.

893
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

894
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,880
- Hi there.
- Hi.

895
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

896
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,480
- I'm Ivan.
- And I'm Markéta.

897
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,480
- A little surprise for you.
- What a journey.

898
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
Yeah?

899
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,560
- Hi.
- It's my first time here.

900
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,040
I'm Týnka.

901
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,800
So will you explain it to me?

902
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,440
It's dangerous to talk about it.

903
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,720
- Who would hear us?
- You never know.

904
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,520
How much older are you?

905
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,360
- Half a century!
- Fifty years?

906
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,520
I've got no wife or kids.

907
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,400
I can do what I want. So...

908
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,400
I thought it might be a problem

909
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,480
that I haven't turned 15 yet.

910
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,800
- Or do you think it doesn't matter?
- It doesn't matter.

911
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,720
You really don't mind that I'm just 12?

912
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,760
You already asked that.

913
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,960
I know but it still feels
weird that like...

914
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,240
- Like what?
- Maybe you wouldn't like me.

915
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,600
If I wasn't into you,
I wouldn't be here.

916
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:24,600
It's like this. You've got
to decide what you want.

917
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,720
I'm telling you straight - I won't
pressure you into anything

918
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,120
or talk you into anything.

919
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,560
If you're into it, we can meet more
often. You can get to know me better.

920
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:46,440
We can go for walks, maybe go
to Žižkov TV tower.

921
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,800
Or get a hot chocolate somewhere.

922
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,560
- What have you brought me? You said you would.
- Chocolate.

923
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,480
- Lots of chocolate.
- What kind?

924
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,440
Strawberry, yoghurt-flavoured,

925
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,760
with nuts, white chocolate.

926
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,370
- What's up?
- Nothing. - Are you nervous?

927
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,400
- What's up?
- Nothing. - Are you nervous?

928
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,640
Big-time.

929
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:33,640
The girl with the dog you sent
me was pretty gross.

930
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,400
Really gross.

931
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,600
You really watch that stuff?

932
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,600
- What's the attraction?
- It's different. - Different?

933
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,120
It's not the same old same old.

934
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,160
I thought lovemaking should
be out of love.

935
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,440
You're still young.

936
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,000
Today's world is sick.
You'll realise when you're older.

937
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,320
Yeah?

938
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,120
What about girls?

939
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,200
Nothing. I'm writing to you right now.

940
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:24,440
I'm on the lookout, but so far
I've had no luck finding...

941
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,440
The right girl?

942
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,480
- So explain it to me.
- What we're going to do?

943
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,640
We'll get there, check in.
I'll take a shower.

944
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,480
Then what?

945
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,520
Then you can join me.

946
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,720
You can touch it and play with it.

947
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,480
I'll show you how to play with yourself.

948
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,080
- I'll show you how much there is.
- How much what?

949
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,280
That stuff when it...

950
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,280
- When what?
- When I come.

951
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,840
I'll enter, in a towel.

952
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,320
I'll lie down on my stomach.

953
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,440
You'll take some oil and drip it on me.

954
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,880
I'll say, Oh, that's cold.

955
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,960
Then you'll start to spread it.
On my back and arms.

956
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,600
Legs, thighs, bum, whatever -
it's up to you.

957
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:49,240
Have you ever had an orgasm?

958
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,560
No.

959
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,720
- So we'll fix that.
- I'm not sure what it is.

960
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:06,600
I'd touch your clitoris.

961
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,520
I'd massage it.

962
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,360
What exactly is the 'clirotis'?

963
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,960
- Clitoris.
- Clitoris, then.

964
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,600
It's a little lump.

965
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,200
- A lump?
- Above the vagina.

966
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,400
- Above the what?
- The vagina. The pussy.

967
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,360
- I thought a lump was some disease.
- No.

968
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:43,480
- Our dog had a lump and it died.
- Depends what kind of a lump.

969
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,320
- I don't have any lump.
- I reckon you do.

970
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,160
Definitely not.

971
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,640
We can check later.

972
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,680
This is what you have.

973
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,560
It's an enlarged image of
something small you have.

974
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,600
- I've got this?
- Yes.

975
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,480
No way. It's ugly.

976
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,440
You've got something
similar... between...

977
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,520
You've definitely got it.

978
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:30,520
Could you, like, explain it to me?

979
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,080
- Explain what?
- What exactly is a threesome?

980
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,280
You tell her.

981
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,360
She'll like...

982
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,200
She'll do what?

983
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:47,920
Basically you lick me down below
and then you fuck him.

984
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,200
That's the basic idea.

985
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,680
- You don't mind that I'm 12?
- No.

986
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:08,560
The thing is, I'm still a virgin.
I've never slept with anyone.

987
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,640
- It's no big deal.
- It's fine.

988
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,360
Are you menstruating yet?

989
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,400
Just a few times and not so much.

990
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,440
Not regular, like.

991
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,640
That'll come when you're 14 or 15.

992
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,600
I only had them regularly from 15.

993
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,640
Above all I don't want you
showing my mum nude photos of me.

994
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,480
So I should put this in my account?

995
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,600
Give it back to me for a minute.

996
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,520
I'm giving you this so that you never
send those photos anywhere.

997
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,640
OK.

998
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,640
But how can I trust you
to never do it?

999
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,240
You keep saying you'll post them
somewhere, send them to my mum,

1000
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:11,280
that you'll get homeless
guys to fuck me.

1001
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,720
Why not say it a bit louder
so everybody can hear.

1002
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,760
Could I ask, for my own peace of mind,

1003
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,480
to erase the messages
we exchanged?

1004
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,520
No problem.

1005
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,120
You mean the one with the cream?

1006
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,160
Start from the bottom.

1007
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,240
Here maybe:

1008
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:41,720
"You can make me come using your
mouth, give me a nice blow job."

1009
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,040
Don't read it out here.

1010
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,280
When you say you want to jizz
inside me - that too?

1011
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,520
- How do you do it?
- "Delete".

1012
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,200
And also "Would you mind if
you got pregnant"?

1013
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:03,440
- "You don't mind that I've got a big one?"
- Delete that too.

1014
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,320
Hang on. What's this?

1015
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,440
This is... for example, like...

1016
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,960
So I don't need to feel embarrassed.
Why not delete everything?

1017
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,400
Why only some? I'll just delete all.

1018
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,560
- Yeah, and then we can start writing again.
- Fine.

1019
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,120
I'm not here.

1020
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,760
Dad. Hi.

1021
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,960
Dad, you don't need to come here.

1022
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,320
Just wait there. Don't go anywhere.

1023
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,600
Are you in the area?

1024
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,200
- I'll go pay.
- Good idea.

1025
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,720
Seeya.

1026
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,880
I'm off.

1027
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,520
That's a pity.

1028
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
Bye.

1029
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:13,480
For three months you want
me to send you gross stuff.

1030
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,480
Keep it down.

1031
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,530
I don't give a shit who hears.

1032
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,560
- I do.
- That's your problem.

1033
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,320
Cool it.

1034
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,200
So it's OK to send a girl of 12 pics
of someone fucking a dog?

1035
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,440
That you write that you're a
pedophile pig?

1036
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:38,480
That you say you want to rape me anally
and fuck me in a car? That's OK to you?

1037
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,480
- Do you feel good about yourself?
- No.

1038
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,560
- Do you think your life is cool?
- No.

1039
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,400
- So why do you do it?
- I don't know. - Wait a sec.

1040
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,600
Thank you.

1041
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,400
I can't change that now.

1042
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,400
I apologise - accept it or not.

1043
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,320
I can't accept your apology
when you're a total pig!

1044
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,480
You posted photos of
a girl of 12 online,

1045
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,560
blackmailed her and were gross to her.

1046
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,600
Oh well.

1047
01:28:25,361 --> 01:28:28,861
Who by violence
or by use of threats

1048
01:28:28,965 --> 01:28:32,965
forces a child
under the age of 15

1049
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:36,987
for masturbation,
or exposing oneself,

1050
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:43,011
is punishable by imprisonment
from 5 to 12 years.

1051
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,720
Shh, you'll betray us.

1052
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,400
- Good evening. Are you Martin _______?
- No, I'm not.

1053
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:07,010
I'm Vít Klusák, this is Bára Chalupová.

1054
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,490
I'm Vít Klusák, this is Bára Chalupová.

1055
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,290
We're making a documentary about
the online abuse of children.

1056
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,520
We're making a documentary about
the online abuse of children.

1057
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,960
What do you want from me?

1058
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,240
You sent photos to our actresses.

1059
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,320
What law did I break?

1060
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,360
It's illegal to send
porn links to minors.

1061
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,090
I've never done that.

1062
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,600
- I can send them back to you.
- Then you'd be doing the same thing.

1063
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,520
You can't expose yourself or tell
a girl of 12 how to masturbate.

1064
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,560
And you've run camps for kids.

1065
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,800
You contact girls in large numbers.

1066
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,800
I've never met up with anyone,
never molested a child.

1067
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,280
You expose yourself over Skype.

1068
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,440
- How do you know it's me?
- We've recorded your face, your penis.

1069
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,640
We know your green walls. We know you.

1070
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,080
- Why do you do it?
- Do what?

1071
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:03,520
Why send your penis to girls of 12?

1072
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,440
I have to go the back way.
Come if you like?

1073
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:12,480
- If you'll speak, why make us chase you?
- OK, give me a question.

1074
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,560
Go ahead.

1075
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:19,720
You work with kids. Do you think it's OK
to send what you do to young girls?

1076
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,040
I can send what I like.

1077
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,480
Unless I send them a link to porn,
which I haven't.

1078
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,520
You did. Our whole crew saw it.

1079
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,080
- A porn link?
- Yes, to child porn.

1080
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,880
"Here are girls like you" -
you sent me that.

1081
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,480
It's totally gross.

1082
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:43,960
Maybe I sent one accidentally.
But that's irrelevant.

1083
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,520
What's the point of what you're doing?

1084
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,880
Guess how many men contacted
them in a week.

1085
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,960
- A thousand.
- Exactly.

1086
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,440
And you're surprised?

1087
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,440
Why not do something worthwhile?

1088
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:03,480
I was in those girls' shoes three months
and I still have nightmares.

1089
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,440
Do you think I care what you or
anybody else think of me?

1090
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:12,480
I don't give a damn
what you think of me.

1091
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,200
If you had a daughter of 12
you'd see it differently.

1092
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:20,480
Go down the road there and
you can buy a 12-year-old.

1093
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,520
That's normal here. Far worse
problems aren't being addressed.

1094
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,530
This hit TV show makes Gypsies look
great but they're all on welfare.

1095
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,960
Why not address that?

1096
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:36,000
Our film's about online child abuse.

1097
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,320
- I find it relaxing, fun.
- Why such young girls?

1098
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,410
Why not find someone older?

1099
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,440
I chat with all ages.

1100
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:48,520
- How old do you think these girls are?
- Fifteen.

1101
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,480
- All fifteen?
- Yeah, maybe.

1102
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,240
- What if they're just 14?
- It's only chat.

1103
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:01,080
- What do you do for fun?
- I look after my four kids.

1104
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,760
I wouldn't like my daughter of nine
to write to somebody like you.

1105
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:11,240
It's your fault she's raised so she goes
online and chats with such types.

1106
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,480
Why did you want photos of us?

1107
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,520
You ordered us to strip on camera.

1108
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:21,440
If you were well brought up,
you wouldn't do it.

1109
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,520
It's the parents' fault.

1110
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,400
You're punishing them for
a bad upbringing?

1111
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,520
No, I'm not. I didn't raise them.

1112
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,440
If a child doesn't tell their parents

1113
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,520
about chatting to some man for hours,
it's their problem, not mine.

1114
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,480
It's not my fault they haven't been
taught to tell their folks everything.

1115
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,520
But you look after children.
I see photos of you as a camp leader.

1116
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,240
I've never touched a child.

1117
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,480
That's not the issue.

1118
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,440
Maybe you affect a child's mind
when you write you adore her.

1119
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,760
Do you know how much it can mess
with a 12-year-old's mind?

1120
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,400
You're skilled at chatting with kids.

1121
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,720
You're charismatic.

1122
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,440
It doesn't occur to you that

1123
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:21,480
this game is a kind of defence for me?

1124
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,480
Against everything that's going on here.
Look around you.

1125
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,880
You're defending yourself by
writing to minors?

1126
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,520
Why concern yourself with such stuff?

1127
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:37,720
So that you stop harming children.

1128
01:34:09,545 --> 01:34:12,239
During the 10 days of filming

1129
01:34:12,269 --> 01:34:17,469
Míše, Týnke and Niky
were attacked by 2458 men in total.

1130
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,924
In the coming weeks

1131
01:34:23,954 --> 01:34:25,954
the girls took part
in 21 meetings "in real life".

1132
01:34:33,028 --> 01:34:37,028
The police of the Czech Republic
requested the filming of material

1133
01:34:37,197 --> 01:34:42,347
and criminal proceedings were initiated
on its basis.

1134
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,960
